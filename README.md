##Craigs Shopping Network

Craigs Shopping Network is a generative home shopping network culled from "For Sale" ads pulled off of New York Craigslist. Sale items and visuals are culled algorithmically by scraping Craigslist's RSS feeds, and are displayed complete with lower thirds and computer-generated voiceover. As we increasingly shift towards the internet as a means of communication, commerce and exchange, "As Seen on TV" means less and less to us as we spend more and more time online; CSN is an experiment in bringing this new mode of transaction into the antiquated marketing methods we've relied on exclusively in the past.
